Description:
		Shows if the mode is active or not. The attribute can be used
		for entering/exiting the mode. Entering/exiting modes is
		supported as synchronous operation so write(2) to the attribute
		does not return until the enter/exit mode operation has
		finished. The attribute is notified when the mode is
		entered/exited so poll(2) on the attribute wakes up.
		Entering/exiting a mode will also generate uevent KOBJ_CHANGE.

		Valid values: yes, no
